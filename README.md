This is my second website I made for my class presentation which also works as my website for now. This was made using HTML, SCSS and some Javascript.

This website is still in development for the mobile viewport, I didnt have the time to finish it as my presentation was in 2 days. Though it is completely fine for Monitor or Laptop viewport

It does contain a Javascript Library called AOS (Animate On Scroll), here is a link to that github repository: https://github.com/michalsnik/aos
